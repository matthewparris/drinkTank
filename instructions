STEPS on deploying site to gh-pages

// make sure gulp is running
// make your changes
// changes should indicate the removal of /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js
inside of the .gitignore (so that we are no longer ignoring our complied code)
// quit gulp (control c)
// add, commit, and push our changes to master branch
// git checkout -b gh-pages (this creates a new branch called gh-pages)
// push our updated code from the master branch into gh-pages by running the following command: 'git push origin gh-pages'
// go back to your github repo for this project, navigate to settings, and under 'GitHub Pages', you should see a link to your live site (this can take a while to propagate)
// in order to continue working on your master branch and further pushing code to this branch, use the following commands:
// git checkout master (this will take us back to our master branch)
// this branch is currently NOT ignoring our /public/styles/style.css & /public/scripts/main.js
// So now we have to RUN gulp
// insert /public/styles/style.css and /public/scripts/main.js back into our .gitignore
// quit gulp
//add, commit, and push changes to master branch (git add -A, git commit -m "", git push origin master)
